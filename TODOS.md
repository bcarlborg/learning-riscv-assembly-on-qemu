# Todos
I like to keep a very simple todo list for little (and big) things that I am planning to do in the near future.
These notes are really just for me, I make no promises that any of this will be done, or that these todos are even coherent.

## General project todos
- why does gdb sometimes jump to the middle of a function after a breakpoint?
  - is it just ignoring the pre-amble etc?
- Put a clearer not in the dependencies that explain how to setup .gdbinit
- create a runtime panic helper

## 05-state-updates
- [ ] add helpers for printing \0 terminalted strings
