# Todos
I like to keep a very simple todo list for little (and big) things that I am planning to do in the near future.
These notes are really just for me, I make no promises that any of this will be done, or that these todos are even coherent.

## overall todos
- make the comments in the readme look nicer
- check that this works on apple silicon macs and on intel based macs then add a comment

## chapter 00 todos
- write the readme
- make it a multi-file program just to highlight the linker
- maybe make it so that we don't have to specify all the source files explicitly
