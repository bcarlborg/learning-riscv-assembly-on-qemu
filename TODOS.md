# Todos
I like to keep a very simple todo list for little (and big) things that I am planning to do in the near future.
These notes are really just for me, I make no promises that any of this will be done, or that these todos are even coherent.

## overall todos
- make the comments in the readme look nicer
- check that this works on apple silicon macs and on intel based macs then add a comment

## chapter 00 todos
- write the readme
- add something that detects your platform and echos the correct instruction to open gdb in another window
- update it to just spin in circles
- make it a multi-file program just to highlight the linker
- maybe make it so that we don't have to specify all the source files explicitly
- cleanup the makefile output consistent objec names

## 01-dipping-our-toes-in-assembly
- Do some basic assembly programming here. The goal is to start to get a hang for writing riscv assembly
- some simple addition, some basic loads and stores

## 02-printing-characters-using-uart
- now that we are a bit more familiar with assembly, we can actually get to our hello world
- shows how to print characters using the uart

## 03-modularization-with-functions
- setting up the stack
- shows how we can start to extract some basic utilities for our printing (printing many character etc)
- calling conventions

## 04-some-other-more-advanced-instructions?-psuedo-instructions?-i-dunno
- will depend on how I have laid it out so far
- long jumps?

## 0?-timer-interrupts (interrupts?)
- setting up mtvec, writing out to the clint

## 0?-uart-reading (interrupts?)
- maybe a slightly more advanced use of uart?

## 0????
- way down the line, I would love to add support for a disc device, possibly a network device?
- add additional chapters that explain supervisor mode, software interrupts etC
